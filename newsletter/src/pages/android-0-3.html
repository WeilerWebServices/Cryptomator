      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator for Android 0.3 Beta</h1>
      <p>Google Drive support is here! Many bugs have been fixed as well, which should improve the overall stability. Release notes are available at <a href="https://cryptomator.org/android/">cryptomator.org/android</a>.</p>
      <p>Our plan is to make the next version 0.4 "feature-complete", so that it's even better integrated into the Android platform. Following that with version 0.5 and so on, we will mainly focus on adding OneDrive and WebDAV.</p>
      <p>Thank you for all your feedback so far! Keep them coming. :) The beta version is not feature-complete and has known issues, but we're of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>

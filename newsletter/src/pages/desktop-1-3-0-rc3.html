      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator 1.3.0 RC 3</h1>
      <p>When we first started with Cryptomator, we had all the source code in one big project. In preparation for the FUSE/Dokany integration, we wanted to modularize its core components. In fact, we had to completely rewrite Cryptomator. The cryptographic code is now available as <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib">CryptoLib</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs">CryptoFS</a>. With that, we're able to write more manageable adapters like <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter">WebDAV</a> and FUSE/Dokany for version 1.4.</p>
      <p><strong>This is a prerelease and is only intended for testing. Wait for the stable release for production purposes.</strong></p>
      <p>Full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.3.0-rc3">here</a>.</p>

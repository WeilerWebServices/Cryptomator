      <h2 class="text-center">Save Passwords to System Keychain</h2>
      <p>On Windows and Mac you can now optionally save your password. This is a preparation for auto-unlock, one of the most wanted features we're planning for the next minor release. Linux support will follow, as soon as we figured out a standard way to protect saved credentials across most distributions.</p>
      <p>Full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.2.0">here</a>.</p>

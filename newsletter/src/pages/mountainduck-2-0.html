      <p>Mountain Duck 2.0 with support for Cryptomator vaults has been released. Mountain Duck lets you mount server and cloud storage as a local disk in Finder on macOS and in File Explorer on Windows.</p>
      <p>After the successful integration of Cryptomator in Cyberduck 6.0, we're excited that Cryptomator has been integrated into Mountain Duck as well. This gives you a new way of accessing your vaults.</p>
      <p>Mountain Duck lets you open remote files with any application and work like on a local volume. FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Amazon S3, OpenStack Swift, Backblaze B2, Microsoft Azure &amp; OneDrive, Google Drive, and Dropbox are the supported protocols. All vaults created with Mountain Duck or Cryptomator can be opened with the other.</p>
      <p>You can learn more about our cooperation with Mountain Duck <a href="https://cryptomator.org/coop/mountainduck_en.html">at our dedicated coop page</a>.</p>

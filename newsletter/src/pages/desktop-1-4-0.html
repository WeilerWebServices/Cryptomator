      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator 1.4.0</h1>
      <p>Introducing Dokany (Windows) and FUSE (macOS, Linux) support. Vaults can now be mounted via Dokany and FUSE which is now the preferred way over WebDAV. Expect vastly improved integration into the system.</p>
      <p>As usual, we have open-sourced the libraries <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/dokany-nio-adapter">Dokany-NIO-Adapter</a> and <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/fuse-nio-adapter">FUSE-NIO-Adapter</a> under AGPL.</p>
      <p>Full release notes and more details are available in our <a href="https://cryptomator.org/blog/2018/11/06/release-1.4.0_en.html">blog post</a>.</p>

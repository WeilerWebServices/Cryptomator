      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator for Android 0.5 Beta</h1>
      <p>OneDrive and WebDAV support is here! And we've added German translation. Release notes are available at <a href="https://cryptomator.org/android/">cryptomator.org/android</a>.</p>
      <p>Just a heads-up: WebDAV is still missing support for self-signed certificates. This will be added with an upcoming patch. In addition, not all WebDAV servers, especially ones which issue redirects, are supported.</p>
      <p>Thank you for all your feedback so far! Keep them coming. :) We're open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>

      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator for Android 0.2 Beta</h1>
      <p>Version 0.2 includes several bug fixes and design improvements. Release notes are available at <a href="https://cryptomator.org/android/">cryptomator.org/android</a>.</p>
      <p>We haven't added further cloud storage services yet, because we wanted to fix some major/critical bugs first (couldn't fix all of them yet; some known issues remain). Our plan is to add Google Drive next for version 0.3, and after that OneDrive and WebDAV.</p>
      <p>Thank you for all your feedback so far! Keep them coming. :) The beta is not feature-complete and has known issues, but we're of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>

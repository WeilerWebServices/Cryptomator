      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator 1.3.0 RC 5</h1>
      <p>Pssst! We're about to release a super secret feature: Auto-Unlock on Start. It's the <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/issues/40">most requested feature</a> in our repository on GitHub and we're excited to give you the chance to be an early tester. It's going to be an experimental feature for 1.3.0 and we'd like to hear your feedback on how it works out for you. :)</p>
      <p>Go to your locked vault, press "More Options", and enable "Auto-Unlock on Start". Auto-unlock is currently only available for Windows and macOS because "Save Password" is a requirement.</p>
      <p>We're planning to implement "Save Password" and "Auto-Unlock" for Linux in a future release. If you feel at home in Linux and love OSS development, you might be able to help us out here. ;)</p>
      <p><strong>This is a prerelease and is only intended for testing. Wait for the stable release for production purposes.</strong></p>
      <p>Full release notes are available <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases/tag/1.3.0-rc5">here</a>.</p>

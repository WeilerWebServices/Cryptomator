      <p>For this first beta version, we're only supporting Dropbox. We'll add Google Drive, OneDrive, and WebDAV in future beta versions. This version is by far not feature-complete and has known issues, but we're of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>
      <p>You can send us feedback on <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android">GitHub</a>. We've created a repository just for collecting Android issues. Please review and follow our <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator-android/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>

      <p>We finally implemented the most-wished feature: Auto-Unlock! Still experimental and will be completed by autostart (optionally hidden) in future versions.</p>
      <p>We've completely rewritten Cryptomator to achieve major under-the-hood improvements. Its core components are now modularized to <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptolib">CryptoLib</a>, <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptofs">CryptoFS</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/cryptomator/webdav-nio-adapter">WebDAV-NIO-Adapter</a>.</p>
      <p>Full release notes and more details are available in our <a href="https://cryptomator.org/blog/2017/07/01/release-1.3.0_en.html">blog post</a>.</p>

      <p>Cryptomator 1.2.5 for iOS and Cryptomator 0.6.0 for Android have been released as well.</p>
      <p>If you've updated to Cryptomator 1.2.4 for iOS before, we're very sorry for the "missing folders" bug. Please update to 1.2.5 and the issue should be resolved.</p>
      <p>We're currently preparing Cryptomator 0.6.1 for Android which will improve local storage support for Android 5.0 or higher. Stay tuned if you're experiencing issues with the new local storage mechanism.</p>

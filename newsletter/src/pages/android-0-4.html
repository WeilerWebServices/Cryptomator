      <h1 class="text-center">Cryptomator for Android 0.4 Beta</h1>
      <p>Surprise! Local storage support is here! And you can now share files to and from Cryptomator more easily with the share functionality. Release notes are available at <a href="https://cryptomator.org/android/">cryptomator.org/android</a>.</p>
      <p>There is probably still a crash bug, when uploading files on certain devices/configurations. We weren't able to reproduce the issue yet, but we have received all your crash reports. If the bug is still present, we'll try to fix it with version 0.5.0. Thank you for your patience!</p>
      <p>We plan to add OneDrive and WebDAV support in the upcoming version 0.5.</p>
      <p>Thank you for all your feedback so far! Keep them coming. :) The beta version is not feature-complete and has known issues, but we're of course open for feature requests, suggestions, and obviously bug reports.</p>

Sharing of Vaults
-----------------

Always be careful when sharing your vault with other people.

In general, keep your vault password secret.
Nobody except youself should know the vault password.
Only when you use a vault together with other people, they may know your vault password.
Keep in mind that other people could pass on – with or without intent – the vault password.
Only share your vaults with people you trust.

If you share a vault with others, do not communicate the vault password on an insecure channel.
Tell the password in person, use encrypted email, or other similar secure means.

Good Passwords
--------------

Bad passwords can be cracked easily when using computers.
Plenty of recommendations exist for secure passwords.
Some of these are:

* A password should not contain public or personal information like the name of your pet, date of birth, or username.
* A password should be long.
* A password should not be an existing word or a combination of few words. It should be a combination of characters or words that is as random as possible.
* For each purpose, a unique password without similarities to other passwords should be used.

If you fulfill these requirements, you quickly reach a point where remembering the passwords gets impossible.
Thus, we recommend to use a password manager to generate and store the passwords.
By doing so, you only have to remember a few or a single secure password.
Otherwise, we recommend to use at least 10 characters, ideally `use sentences instead of words <https://xkcd.com/936/>`_.

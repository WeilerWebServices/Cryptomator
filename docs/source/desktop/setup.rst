Setup
=====

You can start using Cryptomator by simply downloading it for free from our `downloads page <https://cryptomator.org/downloads>`_.
Please choose the appropriate download for your operating system and check the minimum system requirements.

.. note::

    You can find older releases as well as detailed changelogs in the `GitHub releases section <https://github.com/cryptomator/cryptomator/releases>`_.

After downloading, the installation process depends on your operating system.


.. _desktop/setup/windows:

Windows
-------

Launch the downloaded ``.exe`` file and follow the setup as usual.
We recommend also installing *Dokany*, which is included in the installer.

.. note::

    If you are updating Cryptomator by installing a new version and additionally want to update Dokany, you need to remove the old Dokany version first, restart the PC, and then execute the Cryptomator installer.


.. _desktop/setup/macos:

macOS
-----

Open the downloaded ``.dmg`` file, accept the license, and drag & drop Cryptomator onto the Applications folder.
We recommend also installing *FUSE for macOS*, which is linked from inside the ``.dmg`` file.

.. note::

    In case the application is blocked by Gatekeeper, you need to change your `Gatekeeper settings <https://support.apple.com/HT202491>`_.


.. _desktop/setup/linux:

Linux
-----

The primary option of using Cryptomator on Linux is via the AppImage.
After you've downloaded the ``.appimage`` file, you simple need to `make it executable <https://docs.appimage.org/user-guide/run-appimages.html#running-appimages>`_ and you can then run it.

If you are familiar with ``PPA`` or ``AUR``, you can choose one of these options to install Cryptomator.
The coordinates are available on our download page.

Providing the source code is beneficial for security software in general and indispensable for encryption software: We cannot hide vulnerabilities or poor code quality simply for marketing reasons. But more importantly, it makes it impossible for us to build backdoors into the encryption code for advertising partners or secret services.

If we eventually turned evil and stop you from using our software, others can jump in and ensure the continued existence of the applications.

You can find the source code of our various projects on {{<extlink "https://github.com/cryptomator" "github.com/cryptomator">}}.

Cryptomator runs as an application only on your PC or Smartphone. While we are the manufacturer of this software, we are no service provider and neither store, process or otherwise get in touch with your data. Therefore no DPA is needed to use Cryptomator. You keep full control over the data and are the sole person able to access to it!

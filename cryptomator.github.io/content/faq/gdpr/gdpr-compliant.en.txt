title: "Is Cryptomator GPDR-compliant?"
weight: 1

If you intend to store personal data (e.g. employee, customer, patient data, etc.), you must protect this data from access by third parties using suitable security measures. For example, GDPR articles 6, 32 and 34 explicitly refer to the possibility of encryption to protect data.

The use of Cryptomator is therefore such a technical security measure, which is suitable for storing encrypted data in your cloud. Please note that you usually have to sign an additional DPA with your cloud storage provider.
